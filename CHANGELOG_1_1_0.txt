Gypsum-DL 1.1.0 Release 2019

Updates from previous version (1.0.0):

    Dependency updates:
        1) Dimorphite-DL updated from version 1.0.0 to version 1.2.0
            - Details of version changes found in $PATH/gypsum_dl/gypsum_dl/Steps/SMILES/dimorphite_dl/CHANGES.md

        2) Updated MolVS version from v0.1.0 to v0.1.1 2019 release.
            - Details of version changes found in $PATH/gypsum_dl/gypsum_dl/molvs/CHANGELOG.md

        3) Added restrictions to versions of mpi4py. Now Gypsum-DL requires mpi4py versions 2.1.0 or higher.
            - running mpi4py can result in deadlock if a raise Exception is triggered while multiprocessing.
                - For more detail please read: https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mpi4py.run.html 
            - Newer mpi4py version (versions 2.1.0 and higher) provide an alternative command line execution mechanism
            using the -m flag. This implements the runpy module of python.
                - Earlier releases of mpi4py lack the "-m mpi4py".
            - Gypsum-DL also requires the -m mpi4py execution to run in mpi mode. This enforcement was necesary to prevent deadlock issues.

            Deadlock is a serious issue and so Gypsum-Dl has chosen to prevent use of its code with mpi4py versions less than 2.1.0

                -We have extensively tested this and feel that this solution prevents the deadlock issue. If you experirence deadlock please contact us immediately.

            -To test your version of mpi4py open a python window and run the following commands:
                    >>> import mpi4py
                    >>> print(mpi4py.__version__)
                    3.0.1
                    >>> 

    Updates to code base:
        1) Requires mpi4py versions 2.1.0 and higher.
            - Necesary to prevent deadlock in mpi mode
        2) Requires to be run with runpy -m flag ("mpirun -n $NTASKS python -m mpi4py run_gypsum_dl.py ...-settings...") to run in mpi mode.
            - Necesary to prevent deadlock in mpi mode
        3) Updated examples, documentation, and -h documentation to reflect the above modifications.
        4) Add Gypsum-DL citation to print statement.
    
**Fixed bugs:**
    -deadlock in mpi mode: solution restrict mpi4py to version 2.1.0 and higher and require python -m mpi4py run mechanism
